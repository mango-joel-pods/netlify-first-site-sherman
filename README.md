Assuming I am doing this correctly in this document I am to describe the assignment in this specific file. Currently I am crossing my I's and dotting my T's. Yes, that was intentional. I am following the list of instructions you left on canvas and coding the website. The hardest parts of these types of assignments for ME is staying organized and pushing everything to github. Making the site itself is pretty fun if you know how to code.
