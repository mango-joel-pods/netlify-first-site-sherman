<li>Then, run git status command to see the files that have changed</li>
<li>use "git commit -am 'first commit'"</li>
<li>change to the main branch using "git branch -M main"</li>
<li>add the remote repo as the origin of this branch copy and pasting the github link</li>
<li>push the commit using code "git push origin main"</li>
